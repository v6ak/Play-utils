This set of scripts is ABADONNED and OBSOLETE. The only reason for the recent commit was fixing a symlink race vulnerability.

If you use Play 2.*, this set of scripts is not needed and you should use Activator instead.

If you use Play 1.*, this set of scripts might be useful, but I do not maintain it. So, I am not 100% sure if it works for recent Play versions.











There are some scripts that simplify management of multiple Play! versions.

These scripts should work on many UNIX-like OSes. However, they have been tested on some Linux discributions only (including Fedora, Ubuntu and Gentoo).

Cygwin is patrially supported. It should basically work, but it can be less comfortable. Windows Python binaries and play.bat aren't deleted since you need then if you aren't using Cygwin.

Quick start:
1. Add this directory to PATH. Alternativaly, you can use ./create-links /some/directory/in/path
2. Set PLAY_DIR to an empty directory. You can use set-play-dir script.
3. install-play # or install-play <specific version>
4. play new my-great-project, play run, ...


./create-links /usr/bin # create links in /usr/bin
./install-play # install the last stable version
./install-play 1.2.1RC1 # install 1.2.1RC1
./install-play -s # overview


variables:
PLAY_DIR - path to directory with multiple Play! versions
PLAY_VERSION - current Play! version
PLAY_PYTHON_VERSION - current python version (applied when installing only)
